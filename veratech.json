You learn how you walk, think and adapt in any situation. With the knowledge to overcome an opponent one also gains the knowledge to overcome inherent fears and self doubt. This external and internal self knowledge helps us to see that the real enemy is often within. Martial Arts training helps us to nullify these external and internal threats which can lead to salvation and personal preservation.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000080;\"><strong>Overcoming Fear:<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>As soon as you begin a Martial Art you have already made the most difficult step. The inaction of not starting is now behind you. This victory and the experience of beginning a martial art allows you to take more steps that you may have previously thought were not possible.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000080;\"><strong>Stress Release:<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Hitting, striking, kicking and physical expression is incredibly healthy for the body and mind. Our daily lives in the 21st century require our bodies to be placed in some of the most unnatural positions. Think of the drive to work or the hours spent at a desk. A good martial arts class will allow your blood stream to go into hyper flow. This means toxins are flushed and the mind is cleansed. The outside world falls into the background and the practitioner can re-energize and recover through an intense workout.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000080;\"><strong>Focus:<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>This is the key to performance and one of life&#8217;s most underestimated secrets. In our daily lives we are bombarded my media, family, friends and colleagues. A good martial arts session will allow you to focus on a particular task. Martial arts allow the practitioner to re-connect with his or her own sub conscious for true performance and fulfilment. This focus can also be re-applied in business and life. Focus is one of the greatest gifts of Martial Arts and it is also the most illusive.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000080;\"><strong>Balance:<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>It is important to have a life. If you practice a martial art you will have a reason to focus beyond your career. Martial Arts allow practitioners to de-prioritize remedial tasks and hindrances of every day working life. A practitioner of martial arts will develop a greater perspective of work life and this will improve their performance and general outlook.<\/p>\n<p>I would recommend martial arts to all people of any age or gender. There are various large organisations for Karate, Tae Kwon Do and Tai Chi in your local area. Do some research on any martial art you may be interested in and then go and watch a class (which most instructors allow). Take the first step and you will discover a world that promotes safety, knowledge and health.<\/p>\n<p>You will not regret it.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Jared Neems is a Web Developer and Business Development Manager at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.veratech.co.nz\">Veratech Web Solutions<\/a><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon-text sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:<\/h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon\" href=\"http:\/\/veratech.co.nz\/blog\/the-martial-way-5-reasons-why-a-martial-art-will-improve-your-life-and-career\/?share=facebook\" title=\"Share on Facebook\" id=\"sharing-facebook-375\"><span>Facebook<\/span><\/a><\/li><li class=\"share-linkedin\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"share-linkedin sd-button share-icon\" href=\"http:\/\/veratech.co.nz\/blog\/the-martial-way-5-reasons-why-a-martial-art-will-improve-your-life-and-career\/?share=linkedin\" title=\"Click to share on LinkedIn\" id=\"sharing-linkedin-375\"><span>LinkedIn<\/span><\/a><\/li><li class=\"share-google-plus-1\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"share-google-plus-1 sd-button share-icon\" href=\"http:\/\/veratech.co.nz\/blog\/the-martial-way-5-reasons-why-a-martial-art-will-improve-your-life-and-career\/?share=google-plus-1\" title=\"Click to share on Google+\" id=\"sharing-google-375\"><span>Google +1<\/span><\/a><\/li><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon\" href=\"http:\/\/veratech.co.nz\/blog\/the-martial-way-5-reasons-why-a-martial-art-will-improve-your-life-and-career\/?share=twitter\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\" id=\"sharing-twitter-375\"><span>Twitter<\/span><\/a><\/li><li class=\"share-pinterest\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"share-pinterest sd-button share-icon\" href=\"http:\/\/veratech.co.nz\/blog\/the-martial-way-5-reasons-why-a-martial-art-will-improve-your-life-and-career\/?share=pinterest\" title=\"Click to share on Pinterest\"><span>Pinterest<\/span><\/a><\/li><li class=\"share-end\"><\/li><\/ul><\/div><\/div><\/div>","excerpt":"<p>For the last 2 and a half years I have been practicing the ITFNZ Chan Hong style of Tae Kwon Do in New Zealand under Masters Paul Mcphail and Steve Pellow.

After all, who enjoys squinting?&#8221; <\/i><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><i>The new HTC One has been on my desk for the last 2 days and the initial signs are promising. The HTC One is definitely a suave little number.

Thin, smooth, curved and metallic; the HTC One feels like it is worth the $1000.00 it retails for. Resembling the OneX, HTC&#8217;s latest edition has gone a step further in sophistication. The back mount camera has been minimized to adhere with the minimalist styling that dominates the new model&#8217;s aesthetic. The One has a unique look and feel that sets it apart from other Androids and\/or manufacturers.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/veratech.co.nz\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/HTCb.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter\" alt=\"HTCb\" src=\"http:\/\/veratech.co.nz\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/HTCb-1024x478.jpg\" width=\"441\" height=\"206\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000080;\"><b>HTC&#8217;s Rep:<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p>HTC phones first came to our attention when they released the Sensation in 2011. Their devices had a great sense of style and speed. Since then HTC have cleverly crafted an admirable level of brand reputation and perception. This perception is reminiscent of Sony&#8217;s glory days in the 80s and 90s. HTC marketing understand the value of perception and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.htc.com\/us\/go\/heres-to-change\/\"><b><i>are pushing further in a more literal sense.<\/i><\/b><\/a> Brand perception is the most lethal subliminal marketing asset.

The Sony Xperia Z was my preferred choice until I discovered its camera speed. The Xperia had a delayed shutter action. This is a bane if you want to use your smart phone for quick fire imagery. All Iphone users will know and appreciate the feeling of an immediate shutter response that rifles off snaps as fast as your finger can tap. The HTC One has a very responsive shutter action.<\/p>\n<p>HTC&#8217;s camera is a staggering 4 megapixels! (<i>This is not a typo<\/i>). HTC have used new tech called &#8220;Ultra pixel technology&#8221; which, according to the HTC web site, has <i>&#8220;The largest available smartphone camera aperture, it lets in 44% more light than the iPhone 5.&#8221;<\/i> Early reviews say that HTC have a winner.

Transferring files should be as easy as connecting the device and opening a folder. Android delivers this functionality with ease.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/veratech.co.nz\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/droid.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-191\" alt=\"droid\" src=\"http:\/\/veratech.co.nz\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/droid.jpg\" width=\"371\" height=\"292\" \/><\/a><strong><em>Android: Free and easy, for now.<br \/>\n<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000080;\"><b>What about the S4?:<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p>The S4 lost out due to being the popular kid at school. Everyone has a Samsung Galaxy these days. This shouldn&#8217;t matter if one were to make a choice based on logic and performance alone. However, style and brand affinity are a constant and hidden force in the smart phone world. Some people cringe at the fact that phones are perceived, by designers and users alike, as a very <i>personal<\/i> choice. Some cringe further knowing that we spend more time with our phone than any other personal device, or person, for that matter.<\/p>\n<p>Today&#8217;s smart phone purchase trends reflect a level of conformity (Iphone and Galaxy S4). This illustrates a mass consumption teething process that will soon subside.

The truth is that a web site doesn&#8217;t need to look brilliant, it needs to look good.\u00a0In most cases, looking &#8220;kosher&#8221; will suffice. It can even be the preferred approach.<\/p>\n<p>From my experience web site&#8217;s that suffer from &#8220;style vanity&#8221; end up hurting themselves. They usually falter on multiple browsers, have excruciating download times, lack strategic focus and ultimately struggle to eventuate. The style vs. substance argument will continue forever but Bootstrap conveniently balances the scales. Bootstrap sites &#8220;tick all the boxes&#8221; and look professional.<\/p>\n<p>The Veratech web platform, built on bootstrap: <a title=\"Veratech Web Solutions\" href=\"http:\/\/www.veratech.co.nz\" target=\"_blank\">www.veratech.co.nz<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/veratech.co.nz\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/verasite1.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-141 aligncenter\" alt=\"verasite\" src=\"http:\/\/veratech.co.nz\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/verasite1-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" \/><\/a><span style=\"line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>These sharp looks are partly due to the simple infrastructure of Twitter Bootstrap. The Bootstrap grid style framework (currently on a 12 grid system) allows for simple design strategies. Designers can map out a basic plan to execute an online platform. The grid layout is undeniably easy. If you can play noughts and crosses, you can design the layout of a new Twitter Bootstrap site.<\/p>\n<p>Bootstrap Scaffolding provided by:\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/getbootstrap.com\/2.3.2\/\">http:\/\/getbootstrap.com\/2.3.2\/<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/veratech.co.nz\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/scaffold1.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-140 aligncenter\" alt=\"scaffold\" src=\"http:\/\/veratech.co.nz\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/scaffold1-300x129.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"129\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h6 style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>&#8220;If you can play noughts and crosses, you can design the layout of a new Twitter Bootstrap site.&#8221;<\/em><\/h6>\n<p>Bootstrap also ships with CSS3 styling, built in Jquery, icon platforms like http:\/\/fortawesome.github.io\/Font-Awesome\/ Font Awesome. This creates a framework that allows a developer to build a very clear and impressive site. Networking also comes into play. You don&#8217;t have to be Roberto Cavalli to design a great site. If you have $20.00 in your account just visit a template provider and your home free.<\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #000080;\"><strong>Mobile Responsive Capabilities<\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><strong><\/strong><strong><em>Sausage Fingers and the folk in Korea town<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/veratech.co.nz\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/korea.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-173 aligncenter\" alt=\"korea\" src=\"http:\/\/veratech.co.nz\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/korea.jpg\" width=\"315\" height=\"282\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>If Koreans can use sausages to swipe their smartphones in cold weather, developers can at least build sites to make it easy for them. You will be glad to know that Twitter Bootstrap is 100% Mobile Responsive. This means that you can customize the look of your site for different devices. A Bootstrap site will automatically re-size to push key information clearly to the end users on different platforms. Here is an example on our company site on mobile:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/veratech.co.nz\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/verasitemob.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-143 aligncenter\" alt=\"verasitemob\" src=\"http:\/\/veratech.co.nz\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/verasitemob-145x300.jpg\" width=\"145\" height=\"300\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h6 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><em>Bootstrap sites re-size to promote key info on tablets and smartphones\u00a0<\/em><\/strong><\/h6>\n<p>This multi device format requires a little more planning by the owner and\/or developer, however, it creates a very convenient system of pushing users in the right direction when they come to your site. It is a marketers dream as different or similar messages can be constantly promoted, no matter what device the user is on. In case you wondered why this matters check out these stats:<\/p>\n<p><em>&#8221; More than half of New Zealander&#8217;s are now accessing the internet via their mobile phone&#8221;\u00a0<\/em><br \/>\n<em><strong>Statistics NZ<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>&#8220;A report by Nielsen found 45 per cent of the 1.8 million Kiwis who shop online researched their purchases on a smartphone or tablet&#8221;<\/em><br \/>\n<em><strong>NZ Herald<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>&#8221; 80% of Smartphone users have looked for local information and 88% have taken action&#8221;\u00a0<\/em><br \/>\n<em><strong>Google research data<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #000080;\"><strong>Speed<\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><strong><\/strong><em><strong>&#8220;Because in a split second, it&#8217;s gone.&#8221;<\/strong><\/em><br \/>\n<em><strong>Ayrton Senna<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p>As a developer the most amazing part of working with Bootstrap is speed. The speed factor when building on Twitter Bootstrap occurs on multiple levels.<\/p>\n<p>Veratech is currently building <a title=\"Bootstrap Winter Warmup\" href=\"http:\/\/us7.campaign-archive2.com\/?u=f16dc9a53368177e0f82492ca&amp;id=a1fdc82a68\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter Bootstrap sites from $799 +GST<\/a>. This is an insanely cheap web offer. The reason we can do this is because Veratech can churn one of these puppies out within 5 days. We really mean it. You can have a 5 &#8211; 7 page site, that looks professional, is 100% mobile responsive and built within a week. The nimble HTML, CSS Twitter Bootstrap framework is forgiving, immediate and pliable. This means lower prices for clients, a faster turn-around and more effective outcomes.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/veratech.co.nz\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/wrapstrapb.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-163 aligncenter\" alt=\"wrapstrapb\" src=\"http:\/\/veratech.co.nz\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/wrapstrapb-1024x587.jpg\" width=\"438\" height=\"251\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h6 style=\"text-align: center;\">\u00a0<em>A basic Bootstrap site draft from a recent <a title=\"Veratech\" href=\"http:\/\/www.veratech.co.nz\">Veratech<\/a> Project. Bootstrap allows for faster build times and faster performance.<\/em><\/h6>\n<p>The second key factor concerning speed is Twitter Bootstrap&#8217;s load time. Since the framework has been professionally mapped out by the wizz kids at Twitter; Bootstrap behaves accordingly and presents your Web Site at pace. Add to this, the fact that the client has made the smart decision to avoid a CMS, and you have a lightning fast site that looks incredible for a reasonable price.<\/p>\n<p>Lets be honest, CMS&#8217;s like Joomla and Worpress drag their rear ends along the gravel on a good day. This can be embarrassing. You&#8217;ve spent 2 to 4 grand on a slick new CMS site that takes an age to load. The old adage is true: Speed matters and users care.<\/p>\n<p>Some savvy developers will argue that, with correct implementation and hosting credentials, WordPress and even Joomla sites can be very quick. I don&#8217;t care for this nonsensical dribble. As a development company we do not have time to investigate the mysteries of making Joomla or WordPress run faster. Why would we, when we can build a better, faster HTML\/CSS site on Twitter Bootstrap right now with no hassle. More importantly Twitter Bootstrap sites promote work with <strong>real mark-up<\/strong> whilst avoiding CMS backends that require developers to click, then wait, then click&#8230;.and so on.<\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #000080;\"><strong>Joomla, WordPress and Twitter Bootstrap = All together now?<\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><strong><em>CMS implementation:<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>All the CMS lovers out there can rest well knowing that Joomla 3 ships with Bootstrap. Veratech recently built a site that used this technology for\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.impactresearch.org.nz\" target=\"_blank\">Impact Research.<\/a> In contrast, our own <a href=\"http:\/\/www.veratech.co.nz\">Company Web Site<\/a> used Bootstrap in combination with a WordPress Blog. WordPress allows for bootstrap implementation\/combination. So if your really keen on having a CMS on Bootstrap, it is possible.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/veratech.co.nz\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/impact.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-144 aligncenter\" alt=\"impact\" src=\"http:\/\/veratech.co.nz\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/impact-300x166.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"166\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h6 style=\"text-align: center;\">\u00a0<strong><em>Impact Research is a Bootstrap site built on Joomla3.0<\/em><\/strong><\/h6>\n<p>Sadly the templates are far more expensive for CMS systems like WordPress and Joomla. Additionally, some Bootstrap features do not co-operate so willingly within the confines of an additional CMS framework. This means that if Veratech has a client who has their heart set on a Joomla enabled Bootstrap Web Site; more expenditure will be required and the CMS build time will be extended.<\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #000080;\">For the record: Veratech&#8217;s Take on CMS<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><strong><em>\u201cConformity is the jailer of freedom and the enemy of growth.\u201d<\/em><\/strong><br \/>\n<strong><em> John F. Kennedy<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Twitter Bootstrap is not a CMS. This needs to be understood and celebrated. The widespread use of CMS systems is partially driven by managers who require a false sense of security. You may have heard this around the workplace &#8220;We just built the new site, it&#8217;s on Drupal\/Joomla\/Wordpress, have you heard of it? The new intern is learning how to use it.&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/veratech.co.nz\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/cmsdollar.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-155 aligncenter\" alt=\"cmsdollar\" src=\"http:\/\/veratech.co.nz\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/cmsdollar-1024x698.jpg\" width=\"375\" height=\"256\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h6 style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>What approach really is the cheapest? Logos c<\/em>ourtesy of <a title=\"Bootstrap\" href=\"http:\/\/getbootstrap.com\/2.3.2\/\" target=\"_blank\">Bootstrap<\/a>, <a title=\"joomla\" href=\"http:\/\/www.joomla.org\/\" target=\"_blank\">Joomla<\/a>, <a title=\"Drupal\" href=\"https:\/\/drupal.org\/\" target=\"_blank\">Drupal<\/a> and <a title=\"Wordpress\" href=\"http:\/\/wordpress.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress.\u00a0<\/a><\/h6>\n<p>In truth, most small to medium enterprise businesses struggle to use CMS systems. When and if they finally get past the login, they tend to break things, require additional training or end up adding content and styling that is detrimental to their own web site. All this time, money and fuss is poured into a CMS so organizations can avoid paying a developer $50 &#8211; $800 annually. If one were to calculate the money spent on training, fixing errors and the overall decrease in output and efficiency, the previously mentioned attempt at avoiding expenditure seems illogical.<\/p>\n<p>Take our advice. If you do not require an E-commerce site or a blog, build an HTML\/CSS Twitter Bootstrap site and get your developer to make any adjustments. Your stress levels will remain minimal and your web site will be better off.

promoting a local micro brewery. The ad had all the right elements. It was beautifully designed, had a clever catch line and finished with a strong call to action. This looked like the perfect combination for online advertising, but sadly, the wheels fell off.<\/p>\n<p>This ad suffered from what many people overlook in digital marketing campaigns, <strong>barriers<\/strong>. A barrier is a block or required action that the user must comply with to gain access to the content that is being promoted.<\/p>\n<p>The Brewery advert linked to a Facebook page. This meant that viewers had to <strong>login<\/strong> to their Facebook page in order to see the promoted content. This may not sound like a major as most of us log into our Facebook every day. However, requiring users to log in to Facebook after clicking an ad is the wrong way to market online.<\/p>\n<h3><em>&#8220;Consumers online want information quickly. People do not want to wait or work hard for access.&#8221;<\/em><\/h3>\n<p>If you are lucky enough to get a user&#8217;s attention, make it as easy as possible for them to access your content or message. This is why it is still best practice to have a <strong><em>www.website<\/em><\/strong>. A Facebook page is a good option for small and large businesses but is not suitable for all forms of online interaction.<\/p>\n<p>Remember that not all people use Facebook. Many of us hate to login when we don&#8217;t feel like it.\u00a0 These barriers are deterring factors that need to be removed. Try to <strong>link to a web site<\/strong> rather than a Facebook page. The brewery ad promised to show a product video.\u00a0 A Youtube video page would have been the better option as all users would have had easy access to the content in question.<\/p>\n<p><iframe src=\"\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/mx5LBxZHGwU\" height=\"360\" width=\"640\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p><em>Unlike Facebook a Youtube video has no barriers or required logins<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>Email Forms<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The best place to analyze a web sites&#8217; &#8220;<em>ease of use&#8221;<\/em> is it&#8217;s contact page.\u00a0If your contact form requires more information than is necessary via it&#8217;s contact page <strong>change it immediately. <\/strong>Below is a prime example of barrier overload:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/veratech.co.nz\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/07\/bad-contact-form1.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-101\" alt=\"bad-contact-form\" src=\"http:\/\/veratech.co.nz\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/07\/bad-contact-form1-300x180.png\" width=\"624\" height=\"374\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><em>This email form has too many required fields.

Apple TV allows users to access services like\u00a0Netflix,\u00a0Youtube,\u00a0Hulu,\u00a0Vimeo and Itunes to name a few.<\/p>\n<p>The streaming player connects via the HDMI port to your television. It has a compulsory Ethernet port (which connects it to the internet), a power supply and an optical audio port.<\/p>\n<h4><b>So what does it do?<\/b><\/h4>\n<p>It essentially allows your TV to use Apple Apps. E.g. You can sit at your television and watch Youtube. You can also rent a movie from Itunes without having to use your Mac. The Apple TV system uses a custom remote for such tasks.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/veratech.co.nz\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/06\/apple-tvc.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter\" alt=\"apple-tvc\" src=\"http:\/\/veratech.co.nz\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/06\/apple-tvc-300x186.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"186\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h3><\/h3>\n<h3><b>Roku:<\/b><\/h3>\n<p>This brilliant device is the big seller in America.

Much like an Android to an Iphone, the Roku appears to be more expandable and allows users more access to services. It cannot access Youtube (a major let down) but sill boasts an impressive 750 channels as well as basic video games for the kids. Its no PS3 but is a well designed free flowing streaming media player that reputably has one of the best interfaces for selecting channels and services.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/veratech.co.nz\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/06\/roku.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter\" alt=\"roku\" src=\"http:\/\/veratech.co.nz\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/06\/roku-300x168.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"168\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\u00a0<em>The Japanese word for the numeral 6.<\/em><\/p>\n<h4><b>So what does it do?<\/b><\/h4>\n<p>Same as Apple TV but minus Youtube and Itunes.

Wrong. This platform is essentially Android on a television diet. The only thing interesting with Google TV at present are the devices that carry it (see <a href=\"http:\/\/www.pcmag.com\/article2\/0,2817,2418202,00.asp\" target=\"_blank\">Asus&#8217;s rendition of Darth Vader&#8217;s Chihuahua &#8220;The Cube&#8221;<\/a>\u00a0or Sony&#8217;s late 80s inspired\u00a0 <a href=\"http:\/\/www.androidcentral.com\/sony-nsz-gs7-google-tv-player-review\" target=\"_blank\">&#8220;NS-GZ7&#8243;<\/a>)<\/p>\n<p>Apart from the retro form factor, Google TV hasn&#8217;t really hit it&#8217;s straps. It may kick into gear soon as more big names begin to provide internet television access.<\/p>\n<h4><b>So what does it do?<\/b><\/h4>\n<p>An android phone on TV in a big, pretty way.<\/p>\n<h3><\/h3>\n<h3><b>Android HDMI sticks:<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/veratech.co.nz\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/06\/androidonastick.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-68 aligncenter\" alt=\"androidonastick\" src=\"http:\/\/veratech.co.nz\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/06\/androidonastick-300x123.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"123\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>These <a href=\"http:\/\/www.geek.com\/android\/worlds-smallest-android-powered-hdmi-stick-is-only-35-1556370\/\">HDMI devices<\/a> are rather nifty. You can currently find one on Trademe for less than $100 NZD. The Android HDMI option is essentially a mini computer\/plug and play version of a fully functional android operating system. This means that when plugged into your television via the HDMI port your TV can be turned into an android enabled PC.<\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately Android HDMI&#8217;s are not consumer friendly. Many require a wireless mouse or keyboard for practical operation and come from low budget no-name Chinese manufacturers (who would have thought). The cool part is that they are compact and extremely powerful. If you want a cheap and easy way to get Youtube, emails and other Android possible activity to your TV, this is the ghetto way to go about it.<\/p>\n<h4>So What does it do?<\/h4>\n<p>Puts Android on your TV.<\/p>\n<h2><\/h2>\n<h2><\/h2>\n<h2><b>Get Smart?<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/veratech.co.nz\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/06\/smart-tv.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-59 aligncenter\" alt=\"Smart TV's are the new PC?\" src=\"http:\/\/veratech.co.nz\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/06\/smart-tv-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.samsung.com\/nz\/consumer\/tv-audio-video\/television\/\" target=\"_blank\">Smart TV&#8217;s<\/a> are the latest item to plaster every weekend newspaper in New Zealand. All the devices listed previously (Apple TV, Roku etc) turn &#8220;Dumb&#8221; TV&#8217;s into Smart TV&#8217;s. The other option is to buy a new TV, which is &#8220;Smart&#8221;, and you wont have to worry about it being dumb.<\/p>\n<p>Translation: You can buy a Smart TV and allow it&#8217;s inbuilt hardware to provide some of the services listed in the streaming media players above.<\/p>\n<p>Smart TVs are on the pricey side. At the cheapest end of the spectrum you are looking at north of $600.00 NZD. This is a significant sum considering the modest prices associated to the streaming media players ($60.00- $150.00 NZD). It seems that half of our population has recently purchased a cheap LCD &#8220;Dumb&#8221; TV. This rush on big screen &#8220;Dumb&#8221; LCD&#8217;s means streaming media players may be the best choice for your bank account and the environment.<\/p>\n<h2><\/h2>\n<h2><\/h2>\n<h2><b>Providers are the key<\/b><\/h2>\n<p>Kiwis get their internet from greedy ISP&#8217;s who, in many cases, charge for a fixed amount of gigabytes. The world laughs at our broadband pricing structures but the Vodafone&#8217;s and Telecoms of this world are not necessarily the central figures in the net TV saga. They may though, decide the final outcome.<\/p>\n<h3>Hulu, Netflix and the rest<\/h3>\n<p>Internet television has spawned a growing list of reputable content providers. Hulu, which is available on both Apple TV and Roku, provides a hangout for the ever mature Larry King and also boasts hundreds of other shows. MTV, MSNBC, Fox, Netflix, Disney, Youtube, UFC, NBA, Angry Birds (Roku and Android only) and HBO prove that online TV has the content to be an emerging threat to satellite and digital.<\/p>\n<h3>The catch<\/h3>\n<p>Many services such as Netflix and Hulu are not readily available for New Zealand users. This online content is restricted to geographic regions that are classified through our ISP&#8217;s (Internet providers). So sadly, Kiwis get denied when it comes to some of the coolest online TV services. A lot of options still work such as Youtube or Itunes (on Apple TV) but Netflix and Hulu are major, and almost necessary, providers of content for the net TV platform. So for now, Kiwis are left hanging.<\/p>\n<h3>Or are we?<\/h3>\n<p>Slingshot recently made headlines by promoting &#8220;Global Mode&#8221;. It&#8217;s a smart move and Slingshot can obviously smell blood from the sudden up-surge in domestic internet television interest. The company stated that the &#8220;Global Mode&#8221; service, which allows access to foreign services such as Hulu and Netflix, is primarily for tourists and guests to NZ. There is apparently nothing to stop domestic users from utilizing the service. The window for kiwi customers is wide open, for now. Slingshot have Global Mode currently as the main advertising banner <a href=\"http:\/\/www.slingshot.co.nz\/\" target=\"_blank\">on their website.<\/a> &#8220;Tourists&#8221; are obviously their new target market.<\/p>\n<p>This type of behaviour could be the crack before the dam bursts or Sky may move to shut down such operations from NZ ISP&#8217;s in the future.<\/p>\n<h2><\/h2>\n<h2><\/h2>\n<h2>So what should the consumer do?<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/veratech.co.nz\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/06\/q-mark.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-63 aligncenter\" alt=\"q-mark\" src=\"http:\/\/veratech.co.nz\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/06\/q-mark-300x300.jpg\" width=\"180\" height=\"180\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>If watching Rugby or League undisturbed is important to you then it is best to stick with the tried and tested. NZ broadband speeds may be getting faster but the medium can still be inconsistent when compared to satellite transmission.<\/p>\n<p>The good news is that more options are surfacing and Internet television will undoubtedly be the entertainment medium of the near future. The consumer will benefit and there will be more diversified choices at a lower price.<\/p>\n<p>For now, figure out what shows are important to you.\u00a0If your favourite shows are available via the services offered on the steaming media players&#8217;s you may want buy one and see what happens. It could save you from paying that routine sky bill that gently robs you of dollars and days each year.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3><em>Veratech builds mobile responsive web sites and creates digital marketing campaigns.

This means that companies should register with as many Google systems as possible (Google maps, Google wallet, Google Review, Google Plus). If these goggles take off, a company\u2019s online Google identity will be paramount. It reminded me that last year I selected a physio because they had multiple 5 star ratings in the Google Maps customer review section.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;\">Crowd sourcing is the new \u201cin thing\u201d. In America it is seen as the future of innovation. Collective intelligence can give a small company incredible reach and power. Many sites now cater for this new online ideal.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;\">Online identity is set to become an industry. Google your name and see what your current online identity looks like. Companies may have the ability to cater to wealthy individuals who are willing to pay others to manage and create their online identity. This will become an industry in itself.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li>Experimentation in social media is important. This is an interesting fact. SM campaigns can be launched at a minimal cost. This should allow for more experimentation. The only danger is pushing the ledger too far and offending your customers. Be edgy without risking your reputation.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Introducing Teddy Goff, President Obama\u2019s Digital Maestro:<\/strong><br \/>\nTeddy was responsible for managing a truly monstrous digital campaign.

Teddy spoke about how the digital re-election campaign created a Mitt Romney tax policy web page. The joke being that the \u201cclick here to find our policy icon\u201d kept jumping around the web page.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;\">Analytics and metrics were\/are super important.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;\">People trust their friends. This re-enforces the power of social media and highlights the emergence of social media online group strategy and segmentation.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;\">Create good content and don\u2019t be lame. &#8220;Lame&#8221; being the key word.

This included playing it too safe<br \/>\nor simply not understanding your audience.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;\">Reddit.com is big in the America. Google it.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;\">Your social identity is the intersection of 1 what you care about and 2 what you are perceived as caring about. Both are not granted and are certainly not the same thing. Management will decide what 1 is but the audience will decide 2.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;\">All e-commerce sites should create a saved payment system.

Milk isn&#8217;t going to get any cheaper, power prices will probably rise and Apple is wobbling.<\/p>\n<p>The tech giant has had an amazing run over the last decade. Apple experienced a level of success that was the antithesis of it&#8217;s surrounding economic environment. The world wondered whilst Apple rose, and my goodness that rise seemed like a long time. Success is even sweeter when everyone else is in the pit, and Apple had found a nice ledge 1000 feet above the rotting global economy. As long as Jobs was at the helm, Apple looked like a sure thing. The last 18 months have proven that all good things must, and will, come to an end.<\/p>\n<p>Samsung have recently launched the Galaxy S4. The S4 has a larger screen, faster processor, and a staggering 5 megapixels over the Iphone 5. Apple fans of the world will say &#8220;Of cause it&#8217;s better, it&#8217;s a new release!&#8221;. The sad truth for Apple pundits is that the Iphone is becoming less unique, less fashionable, and to put it bluntly, awfully boring.<\/p>\n<p>I remember when I first purchased an Iphone. It was 2008 I was in Tokyo and the world was yet to realize what can now be argued as one of the greatest leaps in consumer technology. My American flatmate repeatedly proclaimed &#8220;Bro I want the Iphone, have you seen that thing? Its sick!&#8221;. I looked at it through the glass display at Softbank Harajuku and decided to take a punt.<\/p>\n<p>The craziest thing about having an Iphone in early 2008 was the feeling that it was almost a niche item. Every time I pulled it out of my pocket on the train I felt a little ashamed. Other passengers would sneak a peak at the strange device with the large screen. Nobody else seemed to have one. As I started to familiarize with the device I realised it&#8217;s significance. Google maps, youtube, mp3&#8242;s and a fully functional online experience were now continually within reach. It even made phone calls. It was smooth, spookily intuitive and had amazing sound quality, something which is still brushed over to this day. How the hell did Apple pull this off?<\/p>\n<p>On my return to New Zealand I ditched it. It was sayonara to the super-device. &#8220;Good bye Iphone, it was fun but you had one crucial floor&#8221;. Apple went on to correct the &#8220;battery issue&#8221; in later models but for me it was a relationship killer. This fact, backed up by the $1000.00 price tag made me disregard the Iphone as a viable option for future purchases. It was just too much for a phone. Rich or poor, to me the price tag seemed offensive.<\/p>\n<p>There&#8217;s one other key word I should mention for the Iphone: &#8220;Snobbery&#8221;. Upon returning from Japan I realised that the Iphone was exceedingly popular in the west. It&#8217;s popularity was almost scary. I realised that half of the people using them didn&#8217;t want the device for its practical implementation. Many people just wanted to fit in. Others wanted status. There was even a few who thought that the Iphone could make them smarter. It was &#8220;fashiontech&#8221; in it&#8217;s truest sense. Soon every career orientated professional who lacked confidence decided that the Iphone would be the ideal placebo.<\/p>\n<p>Fast forward to 2013 and the Iphone is now battling for supremacy. Even die hard Iphone users will be sneaking a peak at their colleagues new S4. Apple is at the cross roads. Will the Iphone star gracefully become a cash cow, plummet to the kennels or will it rise again?<\/p>\n<p>This leads me to the unenviable trait of arrogance. Do all successful people become arrogant? Do all successful companies become arrogant? Apple&#8217;s success in my opinion has undoubtedly developed a level or organisational arrogance. This is certainly reflected in their products. I cringe at the fact that you can buy an Apple device and be denied access to it until you plug it in. Oh, but it gets worse. Not only must it be plugged in, but you must also use the ever user friendly Itunes to get your $1000.00 masterpiece to work. No Itunes on your computer? Download it. No Internet? Hahaha, shame on you. Only an arrogant company could expect consumers to &#8220;work&#8221; for device activation. Apple isn&#8217;t alone in this type of consumer bullying. Microsoft and the IE saga was of a similar ilk.<\/p>\n<p>For me a new device isn&#8217;t defined by its numbered index. Until the S4 was released this week I was unaware that the Iphone 5 even existed. A new device should bring something new to the table. Some may say that every Iphone gets a little better. I say better isn&#8217;t good enough anymore. The first Iphone was better than better. It was groundbreaking, head turning and inspiring. Apple needs another game changer.<\/p>\n<p>Life is definitely harder without Steve. Maybe the next tech guru will be a Korean.
